# Important Point
Some test cases have been implemented within the app.e2e-spec.ts file located in the test directory.
The architecture follows the SOLID principles, which has led to the decision not to create a separate module for authentication.

### The kwanso-test.postman_collection.json file contains the available Postman API collection for your reference.
## To initiate the tests, Run  the command  within the terminal.
```
npm i
npm run test:e2e
```
